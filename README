Beam it Up! lets you quickly project web pages from one computer to another.

Quick Start
------------

Let's say you have two computers, computer A and computer B. Computer A is hooked up to a large LCD screen. Computer B is your laptop. Using Beam it up, you can navigate to a webpage on B, click a bookmarklet, and instantly see that webpage displayed on A.

Here's how to get started:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (versions 0.4.x-0.6.x are supported)
2. Make sure you have NPM (node package manager) installed
3. Clone this git repo
4. cd beamitup/app
5. run: npm install
6. Start beamitup: node app.js

By default, the beam server will run on port 3400. You can change this by manually specifying a port on the command line, such as: node app.js 4400. This will start the server on port 4400.

Once the server is started, open a browser and go to: http://localhost:3400
